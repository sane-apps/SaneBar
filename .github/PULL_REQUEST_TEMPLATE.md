## Sane Philosophy Check

_"Not fear, but power, love, and sound mind" — 2 Timothy 1:7_

- [ ] **Fear**: Does this REDUCE user fear, not create it?
- [ ] **Power**: Does the user maintain control? (No lock-in, no hidden data collection)
- [ ] **Love**: Does this genuinely help people? (Solves real problems, not just technically impressive)
- [ ] **Sound Mind**: Is the UI clear and calm? (No dark patterns, no cognitive overload)
- [ ] **Grandma Test**: Would her life be better with this installed?
