# SaneBar End-to-End Testing Checklist

Start here for active menu bar regressions:
- `docs/MENU_BAR_RUNTIME_PLAYBOOK.md`
- `docs/RUNTIME_AUDIT_2026-03-18.md`

> **MANDATORY**: Run this checklist before every release. Use tracing tools to verify flows.

Canonical scripted runtime path:
- Use `/Applications/SaneBar.app`.
- Do not launch DerivedData builds, archive exports, or legacy `~/Applications/SaneBar.app` copies directly.
- Before any release-style smoke, dedupe installed/build copies:

```bash
~/SaneApps/infra/SaneProcess/scripts/SaneMaster.rb dedupe_apps --host mini --apps SaneBar
```

- For smoke runs, pin the target explicitly:

```bash
SANEBAR_SMOKE_APP_ID=com.sanebar.app \
SANEBAR_SMOKE_APP_PATH=/Applications/SaneBar.app \
SANEBAR_SMOKE_PROCESS_PATH=/Applications/SaneBar.app/Contents/MacOS/SaneBar \
./Scripts/live_zone_smoke.rb
```

The live smoke now includes a resource watchdog:
- sustained CPU over `120%` fails
- sustained RSS over `1024 MB` fails
- emergency CPU/RSS spikes fail immediately
- a native macOS process sample is written to `/tmp/sanebar_runtime_resource_sample.txt` when the watchdog trips
- launch idle budget: average CPU must settle under `5%`, peak CPU under `15%`, RSS under `128 MB`
- post-smoke idle budget: after an `8s` settle window, average CPU must settle back under `5%`, peak CPU under `20%`, RSS under `128 MB`
- whole-pass stress budget: average CPU must stay under `15%`, average RSS under `192 MB`
- second-menu-bar activation must stay open for both left-click and right-click browse flows
- the script-based browse activation lane must use the same idle-close protection as the real panel UI lane

If the Mini falls back to an unsigned `~/Applications/SaneBar.app` build because headless signing is blocked:
- keep that copy only for current-tree debug checks
- preserve `/Applications/SaneBar.app` as the signed/trusted release baseline
- use the signed `/Applications` app for release-style smoke unless you have a freshly trusted signed current build

## Critical Runtime Regression Matrix

These checks are mandatory for the current startup / browse / move bug class. Do not call this class fixed without them.

| Check | Why it exists | Must prove |
|------|------|------|
| Cold-start restore with valid current-width backup and poisoned `main=0 / separator=1` | Catches startup recovery collapse family (`#111/#113/#114/#115`) | backup restore beats ordinal reseed, visible lane stays sane |
| Cold-start with `autoRehide=false` | Catches hidden-after-launch regressions | no initial hide after deferred setup |
| Right-click browse focus integrity | Catches `#116` | failed browse activation never changes frontmost app/window |
| Hidden-visible move under stale geometry | Catches wrong-zone false success | retry or fail cleanly, never report wrong success |
| Shared-bundle exact-ID move | Catches `#117` class drift | requested `unique_id` is what moved, not a sibling |
| Restart/update recovery replay | Catches persistence drift | current-width backup survives relaunch and autosave churn |

Release rule:
- if smoke says `No movable candidate icon found; skipping move checks`, treat that as incomplete coverage, not a pass
- if browse diagnostics show `workspace activation fallback` during browse-panel right-click, treat that as a failure even if the panel stayed visible

## Pre-Test Setup

```bash
# 1. Build and launch fresh
./scripts/SaneMaster.rb test_mode

# 2. Generate button map (see all UI controls)
./scripts/button_map.rb

# 3. Trace specific function (if debugging)
./scripts/trace_flow.rb <function_name>
```

## 🐛 COMMON FAILURE MODES

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Check |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| Toggle doesn't persist | Settings not saving | Check `saveSettings()` call |
| Toggle reveals icons unexpectedly | Settings observer side effect | Check `$settings` sink |
| Spacers not visible | Count is 0 or positions wrong | Check `spacerCount` value |
| Auth bypassed | Trigger path skips auth | Trace flow to `authenticate()` |
| Menu bar overlay missing | Appearance disabled | Check `isEnabled` flag |

---

## Post-Test

```bash
# Verify no crashes in logs
./scripts/SaneMaster.rb logs --tail 50

# Check for warnings
