I did what you told me: I reduced the number of additional spaces in the Settings panel. But dragging outside the menubar is a more usual way to take things out of it.
For the popovers, I didn't noticed again the problem again since yesterday.
The idea of the pannel that list all the menubar module is OK but isn't a substitude for a second bar.
For exemple, yesterady I had le dynamic island Atoll actvate on the large 32” moniteor. and SaneBar was active too.
When I wanted to change some settings in a module, I opened the Search panel, found it... but the module was "uploaded" in the menubar BEHIND the dynamic island, so it was unreachable. I had to close Atoll to access the menubar module and make the change. It is worse with the Alter AI assistant, as it takes up more than 15 cm at the notch place... so when I unmask some modules, more of them are, of course, under the Alter notch interface.
The only way to solve the problem is to deport menu bar modules to a second bar which isn't "inline" with the main bar, so whatever uses the notch will not interfere with the user wanting to use menubar modules.
10:05 PM
Another way to avoid using a second menu bar would perhaps be that, when I upload a menubar module from the Search panel, it is placed at the very first possible position on the Right of the menubar, so it will be immediately accessible. I don’t know if that would be possible; I have never seen that behaviour in any menubar management solution.'

Try this:

  brew install --cask stephanjoseph/sanebar/sanebar

You know what tho it is 2026 and Claude in terminal is a thing. If you want to clone it and ask Claude to make it work on your machine I'm like 99% sure it could do that since it can SEE your machine and setup...maybe a fun weekend project. If it works flawlessly to your expectations tell Claude to push it to Git and I'll review it.'

[2026-01-17T17:03:44-05:00] EXTRACTED PROMPT: 'you froze up AGAIN! heres where you were. trying to start over since youve complicated a SIMPLE thing into oblivion.                                    
⏺ Now I understand the correct pattern. Here's the fix based on Ice's proven    
  approach:                                                                     
                                                                                
  The Fix: Before creating status items, we need to seed the NSStatusItem       
  Preferred Position keys with ordinal values:                                  
  - Main icon → position 0 (rightmost, near Control Center)                     
  - Separator → position 1 (second from right, LEFT of main)                    
                                                                                
  Should I implement this fix now? It's a small, targeted change to add         
  UserDefaults seeding before autosaveName assignment, following Ice's exact    
  pattern.

❯ yes we dont need to recreate the fucking wheel here. the meny bar manager     
  part shoud be the MOST simple part of our app im positive we've added         
  about 100 layers of complexity to it by now. Simple mechanics am I wrong?     
  why is it so hard to get this right???                                        
                                                                                
⏺ You're 100% right. This should be dead simple:                                
                                                                                
  1. Create two status items                                                    
  2. Tell macOS where to put them                                               
  3. Done                                                                       
                                                                                
  Ice does it in ~10 lines. We've written hundreds of lines of "recovery logic",
   "swap mechanisms", "position validation", "nudge windows" - all because we   
  never looked up the actual API.
