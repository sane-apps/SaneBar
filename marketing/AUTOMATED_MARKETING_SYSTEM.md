## 📝 Content Templates (Ready to Use)

### Twitter Thread Template
```
1/ I built a menu bar manager because Bartender got acquired and added telemetry.

2/ The problem: Your menu bar is cluttered, but existing solutions either spy on you (Bartender) or break on every macOS update (Ice).

3/ SaneBar is different:
- Touch ID to reveal hidden icons
- Zero network calls (verify with Little Snitch)
- Works on macOS Tahoe
- $5 one-time, or build from source

4/ It's been 3 weeks since launch:
- XXX GitHub stars
- XXX paying customers
- Zero complaints about privacy

5/ If your menu bar looks like this... [screenshot]

Try SaneBar: https://sanebar.com
```

### Mastodon Post Template
```
Built a menu bar manager for macOS that doesn't spy on you.

- No analytics
- No telemetry
- No network calls at all

Verify yourself: `sudo lsof -i -n -P | grep SaneBar` returns nothing.

$5 or build from source: https://sanebar.com

#macOS #privacy #indiedev
```

### Crypto-Focused Post Template
```
For the privacy-conscious: SaneBar now accepts BTC/ETH.

- Zero telemetry (verify the source)
- No account required
- No payment data stored

Your menu bar manager shouldn't know who you are.
