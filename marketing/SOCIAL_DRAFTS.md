```
**Status:** Ready to post

### Draft 2: Privacy Angle
```
Your menu bar manager shouldn't spy on you.

SaneBar makes zero network calls. Ever.

Verify yourself:
sudo lsof -i -n -P | grep SaneBar

Returns nothing. That's the point.

```
**Status:** Ready to post (day 2)

### Draft 3: Competitor Pain Point
```
If you're frustrated with Ice crashing on macOS Tahoe...

I built SaneBar because I had the same problem.

• Actually works on 26.x
• 100% Transparent Code
• $6.99 one-time (or free to build)
