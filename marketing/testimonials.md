### vvmac.fr — January 2026

> **Context**: French Mac blog review of SaneBar 1.0.11. Mixed/cautiously positive — reviewer prefers Barbee for his specific use case but praises SaneBar's features.

**Link**: https://vvmac.fr/wordpress_b/sanebar-1-0-11-il-gere-de-facon-inedite-les-modules-de-barre-de-menus/

**SaneBar Highlights from the Review:**

| Quote (translated) | Context |
|-------|---------|
| "Stable and effective" | Overall impression |
| "Only tool offering Touch ID/password protection" | Security feature praise |
| "Extensive personalization options" | Customization |
| "$6.99 one-time purchase includes all future updates" | Pricing model |

**Criticisms:**
- Doesn't solve notch-area conflicts for users with many menu bar items
- Reviewer personally prefers Barbee for his atypical setup
- Building from source requires technical knowledge

**Verdict**: Conditional recommendation — good for typical users, not for power users with extreme icon counts.
