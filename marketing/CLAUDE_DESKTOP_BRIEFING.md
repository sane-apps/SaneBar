## What is SaneBar?

SaneBar is a **menu bar manager for macOS** that hides cluttered icons and reveals them on demand. Think of it as "minimalism for your menu bar."

**Website:** https://sanebar.com
**GitHub:** https://github.com/sane-apps/SaneBar (source available)
**Price:** $6.99 one-time (or build from source for free)

---

## Key Differentiators (ONLY SaneBar has these)

| Feature | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Touch ID Lock** | Biometric protection for hidden icons |
| **Gesture Controls** | Scroll, hover, or click to reveal |
| **Smart Triggers** | Auto-reveal on low battery, Wi-Fi change, Focus mode, or app launch |
| **Auto-Hide on App Switch** | Icons hide when you switch apps |
| **Menu Bar Spacing** | Control spacing between all menu bar icons system-wide |

---

## Competitors

| App | Price | Comparison |
|-----|-------|------------|
| **Bartender** | $16 | More features, but subscription rumors and sold to unknown company |
| **Ice** | Free | Good but no Touch ID, no Smart Triggers, less polish |
| **Hidden Bar** | Free | Very basic, no advanced features |
| **Vanilla** | $5 | Abandoned, doesn't work on modern macOS |

**Our angle:** Bartender's privacy concerns + Ice's limitations = SaneBar opportunity

---

## Target Audience

1. **Privacy-conscious Mac users** - Worried about Bartender's new ownership
2. **Minimalists** - Want clean menu bar aesthetic
3. **Power users** - Need smart automation (triggers, gestures)
